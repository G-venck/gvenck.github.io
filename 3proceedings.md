The growing demand for food makes breeders pursue more productive, stable and
resistant genotypes. However, finding the best breeding strategy is not simple. It is a
multidisciplinary and dynamic science and the combination of classical and modern
approaches may constitute an important approach to promote higher genetic gains.
Based on this idea, our event is focused on fostering discussions with key
professionals in genetics and plant breeding in order to prepare stakeholders for
challenges in agriculture.
The International Meeting on Plant Breeding is one of several events in the "DuPont
Plant Sciences Symposia" series. Our aim is training new professionals by providing
the opportunity to interact with researchers from public and private institutions
through discussions of relevant scientific topics.
