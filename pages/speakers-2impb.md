Alexander Lipka received his Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University under the direction of co-advisors Prof. RW Doerge and Prof. George McCabe.

Afterwards, he was a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Dr. Edward Buckler and Prof. Michael Gore. In this capacity, he conducted genome-wide association studies and genomic selection for a wide variety of crops and traits, most notably for vitamin levels in maize grain. He also co-developed the Genome Association and Prediction Integrated Tool (GAPIT) R package, which is currently widely used among the plant genetics research community. Dr. Lipka is now an Assistant Professor of Biometry in the Department of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.

A Augusto F Garcia has a PhD in Genetics and Plant Breeding (Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture - ESALQ, University of São Paulo - USP) and a postdoc in Statistical Genetics (Bioinformatics Research Center, North Carolina State University, USA).

He is Associate Professor at Department of Genetics (ESALQ/USP), and leads a Statistical Genetics Laboratory with around 10 students (undergrads, MSC, PhDs and postdocs). He has been working on the development of statistical models to have a better understand of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits and to implement molecular breeding in several crops, including maize, sorghum and (specially) sugarcane. He participates of the National Institute of Science and Technology (INCT) of Bioethanol (FAPESP and CNPq). His research achievements include the development of a software (OneMap, and R package) that is used worldwide for building integrated genetic maps; several statistical methods for QTL mapping (including studies on heterosis and interaction G x E); and also methods for genotyping and mapping polyploids. He is editor of Theoretical and  Applied Genetics.

Jeffrey Endelman is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Horticulture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a member of the graduate program in Plant Breeding and Plant Genetics.

Endelman trained as a computational scientist (PhD Caltech) before discovering his passion for agriculture and retraining as a plant breeder at Washington State University (PhD) and Cornell (postdoc). Endelman leads the potato breeding program at UW-Madison, which releases new varieties for the chip, French fry, and fresh markets (potatobreeding.cals.wisc.edu). Current research interests include genomics-assisted breeding for autotetraploids, the development of inbred-hybrid breeding for potato, and the genetics of potato tuber appearance. Endelman teaches an undergraduate course on genetically modified crops and graduate courses on genetic mapping and polyploid genetics.

Dr. Jesse Poland is an Associate Professor at Kansas State University in the Department of Plant Pathology. He is appointed to the graduate faculty in Genetics, Plant Pathology and Agronomy where he serves as major professor and committee member for students in plant breeding and genetics.

Dr. Poland is the Director of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Applied Wheat Genomics with focus on applying genomics tools to accelerate wheat breeding and develop climate resilient wheat varieties throughout the world. As Associate Director of the Wheat Genetics Resource Center, Dr. Poland leads research to characterize wild wheat germplasm and leveraging valuable genetic diversity for wheat improvement for increased resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. The overall focus of the Poland Lab is on quantitative genetics, genomics and high-throughput phenotyping for use in breeding, diversity studies, and association genetics with the overall goal of understanding the wheat genome and increasing genetic gain in wheat breeding. In collaboration with public breeding programs, Dr. Poland is implementing the use of genomic selection methods to accelerate wheat breeding. In the area of germplasm development, Dr. Poland’s group is focused on developing new breeding lines with resistance to the major pests of wheat including stem rust, stripe rust, leaf rust, Barley Yellow Dwarf virus and Hessian Fly while increasing the understanding of the genetic basis of these traits. To compliment advances in genomics, Dr. Poland’s lab is actively developing and applying high-throughput phenotyping approaches for field-based evaluation of breeding lines with the primary focus being genetic characterization of heat and drought tolerance and development of improved germplasm. Dr. Poland currently supervises five graduate students as major professor and is mentor to nine post-doctoral scholars. He teaches graduate courses in plant genetics and serves as advisor for the plant breeding and genetic graduate student club.

She then worked in the commercial sector for approximately two years before moving to the University of Wisconsin. She is currently a professor in the Department of Agronomy, Plant Breeding and Plant Genetics program at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Her research program focuses on integrating different sources of information to accelerate translational research for enhanced crop productivity, specially focusing in maize.
