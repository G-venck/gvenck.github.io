Intergen's had its first edition in Lavras - MG last year. It was created to promote
integration between students and genetics and plant breeding groups of universities.
This year, the II Intergen's set place at the 10º Brazilian Congress of Plant Breeding.  

The following groups were present:  

GVENCK - School of Agriculture "Luís de Queiroz"  
Gen - Federal University of Lavras  
GenMelhor - Federal University of Viçosa  
GEMP - Paulista State University "Julio de Mesquita Filho"  
Genetic gain - Norte Fluminense State University  
EuGeM - Federal University of Goiás  

Dr. Adriano Mastrodomenico, a maize breeder at Limagrain, then spoke about: "How to
be a breeder: what you don't learn at school."  

In addition to the group presentations and lecture, we had a round table with Dr.
Adriano and Dr. Tabare who shared their professional experiences with us.
In the end, there were giveaways of gifts that enjoy the students.  

We thank you for the presence of the groups, the contributions of Dr. Adriano and Dr.
Tabare for our professional life. We also thanks to everyone for the participation!
See you at the next Intergen's!
