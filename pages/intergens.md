On July 7, 2018, I Intergen's Meeting was held between Genetics and Plant Breeding Groups.  

 The event was attended by the following groups: GEN (Núcleo de estudos em Genética e Melhoramento de Plantas), GenMelhor (Grupo de estudos em Genética e Melhoramento) and GVENCK (Grupo de Estudos em Genética e Melhoramento de Plantas "Profº Roland Vencovsky").  

In the opening, Prof. Magno Ramalho spoke about the creation of UFLA, the Graduate course in Genetics and Plant Breeding and the Nucleus of Study.   

We also have the presence of Dr. Fernanda Medeiros who shared her experience in Private and Public Institution.   

To conclude, a dynamic was carried out in order to integrate students from different study groups.   

With this event, it was possible to meet students from different universities and share experiences, in addition to making possible future contacts!
